              " “A political agreement should, first and foremost, be aimed at returning the refugees, and second, at preventing the spread of international terrorism, since Syria has become its stronghold,” Alfano said noting that the Astana meetings “are very important as far as the ceasefire is concerned.”\n",

              " “A political agreement should, first and foremost, be aimed at returning the refugees, and second, at preventing the spread of international terrorism, since Syria has become its stronghold,” Alfano said noting that the Astana meetings “are very important as far as the ceasefire is concerned.”\n",

              " “A political agreement should, first and foremost, be aimed at returning the refugees, and second, at preventing the spread of international terrorism, since Syria has become its stronghold,” Alfano said noting that the Astana meetings “are very important as far as the ceasefire is concerned.”\n",

But that does not mean the future constitution will not contain provisions concerning administrative decentralization,” the UN envoy concluded.\n",

              " “A political agreement should, first and foremost, be aimed at returning the refugees, and second, at preventing the spread of international terrorism, since Syria has become its stronghold,” Alfano said noting that the Astana meetings “are very important as far as the ceasefire is concerned.”\n",
